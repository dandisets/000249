description: Infant cries evoke powerful responses in parents. Whether parental animals
  are intrinsically sensitive to neonatal vocalizations, or instead learn about vocal
  cues for parenting responses is unclear. In mice, pup-naive virgin females do not
  recognize the meaning of pup distress calls, but retrieve isolated pups to the nest
  after having been co-housed with a mother and litte. Distress calls are variable,
  and require co-caring virgin mice to generalize across calls for reliable retrieval.
  Here we show that the onset of maternal behaviour in mice results from interactions
  between intrinsic mechanisms and experience-dependent plasticity in the auditory
  cortex. In maternal females, calls with inter-syllable intervals (ISIs) from 75
  to 375 milliseconds elicited pup retrieval, and cortical responses were generalized
  across these ISIs. By contrast, naive virgins were neuronally and behaviourally
  sensitized to the most common (‘prototypical’) ISIs. Inhibitory and excitatory neural
  responses were initially mismatched in the cortex of naive mice, with untuned inhibition
  and overly narrow excitation. During co-housing experiments, excitatory responses
  broadened to represent a wider range of ISIs, whereas inhibitory tuning sharpened
  to form a perceptual boundary. We presented synthetic calls during co-housing and
  observed that neurobehavioural responses adjusted to match these statistics, a process
  that required cortical activity and the hypothalamic oxytocin system. Neuroplastic
  mechanisms therefore build on an intrinsic sensitivity in the mouse auditory cortex,
  and enable rapid plasticity for reliable parenting behaviour.
